# Keenwork

## Keenwork = Guzzle + SlimPHP + PHP DI + Workerman + minimum magic

Comet gets all superpowers from Guzzle, Slim and Workerman components as well as adds its own magic.

[Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle) is a set of PHP components to work with HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 services.

[Slim](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim) is a micro-framework that helps write web applications and APIs based on modern PSR standards.

[Workerman](https://github.com/walkor/Workerman) is an asynchronous event-driven framework to build fast and scalable network applications. 

Keenwork allows you natively use all the methods of Slim: http://www.slimframework.com/docs/v4/
